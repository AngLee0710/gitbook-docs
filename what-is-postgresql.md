# 什麼是PostgreSQL？

PostgreSQLis an object-relational database management system \(ORDBMS\) based on[POSTGRES, Version 4.2](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/postgres.html), developed at the University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Department. POSTGRES pioneered many concepts that only became available in some commercial database systems much later.

PostgreSQLis an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and offers many modern features:

* complex queries
* foreign keys
* triggers
* updatable views
* transactional integrity
* multiversion concurrency control

Also,PostgreSQLcan be extended by the user in many ways, for example by adding new

* data types
* functions
* operators
* aggregate functions
* index methods
* procedural languages

And because of the liberal license,PostgreSQLcan be used, modified, and distributed by anyone free of charge for any purpose, be it private, commercial, or academic.
