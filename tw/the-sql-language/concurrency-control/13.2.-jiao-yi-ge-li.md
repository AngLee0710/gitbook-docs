# 13.2. 交易隔離

SQL 標準中定義了四個等級的交易隔離，其中最嚴格的隔離是「序列化（Serializable）」。序列化在標準的描述中，被定義為任意序列化交易的共時操作，都會保證產出與依照某種任意順序一個一個執行它們的效果相同。The other three levels are defined in terms of phenomena, resulting from interaction between concurrent transactions, which must not occur at each level. The standard notes that due to the definition of Serializable, none of these phenomena are possible at that level. \(This is hardly surprising -- if the effect of the transactions must be consistent with having been run one at a time, how could you see any phenomena caused by interactions?\)

在不同等級中被禁止的現象是：

`dirty read（髒讀）`
交易讀取的資料是由尚未提交的共時交易寫入的。

`nonrepeatable read（無法重複的讀取）`
交易重新讀取它之前讀過的資料，但是卻發現資料被其他交易修改（在最初讀取之後提交）了。

`phantom read（幻讀）`
交易重新執行查詢，得到滿足搜尋條件的資料集，但卻發現得到的資料集因為其他最近剛提交的交易而變更了。

`serialization anomaly（序列化異常）`
在成功提交一群交易後，結果與以所有可能的順序依序執行交易的結果都不一致。

SQL 標準以及 PostgreSQL 實作的交易隔離等級，可參閱 Table 13.1。

**Table 13.1. 交易隔離等級**

| Isolation Level | Dirty Read | Nonrepeatable Read | Phantom Read | Serialization Anomaly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Read uncommitted | Allowed, but not in PG | Possible | Possible | Possible |
| Read committed | Not possible | Possible | Possible | Possible |
| Repeatable read | Not possible | Not possible | Allowed, but not in PG | Possible |
| Serializable | Not possible | Not possible | Not possible | Not possible |

在 PostgreSQL 當中，你可以要求上述四種交易隔離等級的任何一種，但在 PostgreSQL 內部實際上實作的只有三種隔離等級。舉例來說，PostgreSQL 的 Read Uncommitted 模式跟 Read Committed 的行為很相像，這是因為這是能夠把標準的隔離等級對應到 PostgreSQL 的 MVCC 架構的明智方法。

表格中也顯示了 PostgreSQL 的 Repeatable Read 的實作並不允許 phantom read。關於這點，在 SQL 標準中，更嚴格的行為是被容許的：標準中定義的四個隔離等級，只定義了哪些現象必須不會發生，而沒有定義哪些現象 _必須_ 發生。可用的隔離等級的行為，在接下來的小節中會詳細描述。

若要設定交易的隔離等級，可使用指令 [SET TRANSACTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-set-transaction.html)。

#### 重要

有些 PostgreSQL 的資料型態和函式具有特殊的交易行為的規則。具體來說，對序列（以及以 `serial` 宣告的計算器欄位）造成的變更將會立刻能夠被所有其他交易所看見，並且即使造成變更的交易取消了也不會被還原。請參考 [9.16 小節](../functions-and-operators/9.16.-xu-lie-han-shi) 及 [8.1.4 小節](../data-types/numeric-types#8-1-4-xu-lie-xing-serial-types)。

#### 13.2.1. Read Committed Isolation Level

_Read Committed（提交讀）_ 是 PostgreSQL 預設的隔離等級。當交易使用這個隔離等級時，一個 `SELECT` 的查詢（沒有 `FOR UPDATE/SHARE` 的宣告）在查詢開始前已經被提交的資料；它不會看見尚未提交的資料或者是在查詢執行過程中被共時的交易提交的變更。實際上，`SELECT` 查詢是看見了在查詢開始執行的那一瞬間的資料庫快照。然而，`SELECT` 會看見在它自己的交易中比它先執行的更新，即使那些更新尚未被提交。同時需要注意的是，對於兩個成功的 `SELECT` 指令，如果其他交易在第一個 `SELECT` 開始後、第二個 `SELECT` 開始前提交變更，則即使這兩個 `SELECT` 在同一個交易中也可能會看見不同的資料，

`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, and `SELECT FOR SHARE` commands behave the same as `SELECT` in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows that were committed as of the command start time. However, such a target row might have already been updated \(or deleted or locked\) by another concurrent transaction by the time it is found. In this case, the would-be updater will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or roll back \(if it is still in progress\). If the first updater rolls back, then its effects are negated and the second updater can proceed with updating the originally found row. If the first updater commits, the second updater will ignore the row if the first updater deleted it, otherwise it will attempt to apply its operation to the updated version of the row. The search condition of the command \(the `WHERE` clause\) is re-evaluated to see if the updated version of the row still matches the search condition. If so, the second updater proceeds with its operation using the updated version of the row. In the case of `SELECT FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT FOR SHARE`, this means it is the updated version of the row that is locked and returned to the client.

`INSERT` with an `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` clause behaves similarly. In Read Committed mode, each row proposed for insertion will either insert or update. Unless there are unrelated errors, one of those two outcomes is guaranteed. If a conflict originates in another transaction whose effects are not yet visible to the `INSERT` , the `UPDATE` clause will affect that row, even though possibly _no_ version of that row is conventionally visible to the command.

`INSERT` with an `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` clause may have insertion not proceed for a row due to the outcome of another transaction whose effects are not visible to the `INSERT`snapshot. Again, this is only the case in Read Committed mode.

Because of the above rules, it is possible for an updating command to see an inconsistent snapshot: it can see the effects of concurrent updating commands on the same rows it is trying to update, but it does not see effects of those commands on other rows in the database. This behavior makes Read Committed mode unsuitable for commands that involve complex search conditions; however, it is just right for simpler cases. For example, consider updating bank balances with transactions like:

```text
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 7534;
COMMIT;
```

If two such transactions concurrently try to change the balance of account 12345, we clearly want the second transaction to start with the updated version of the account's row. Because each command is affecting only a predetermined row, letting it see the updated version of the row does not create any troublesome inconsistency.

More complex usage can produce undesirable results in Read Committed mode. For example, consider a `DELETE` command operating on data that is being both added and removed from its restriction criteria by another command, e.g., assume `website` is a two-row table with `website.hits` equaling `9` and `10`:

```text
BEGIN;
UPDATE website SET hits = hits + 1;
-- run from another session:  DELETE FROM website WHERE hits = 10;
COMMIT;
```

The `DELETE` will have no effect even though there is a `website.hits = 10` row before and after the `UPDATE`. This occurs because the pre-update row value `9` is skipped, and when the `UPDATE` completes and `DELETE` obtains a lock, the new row value is no longer `10` but `11`, which no longer matches the criteria.

Because Read Committed mode starts each command with a new snapshot that includes all transactions committed up to that instant, subsequent commands in the same transaction will see the effects of the committed concurrent transaction in any case. The point at issue above is whether or not a _single_ command sees an absolutely consistent view of the database.

The partial transaction isolation provided by Read Committed mode is adequate for many applications, and this mode is fast and simple to use; however, it is not sufficient for all cases. Applications that do complex queries and updates might require a more rigorously consistent view of the database than Read Committed mode provides.

#### 13.2.2. Repeatable Read Isolation Level

The _Repeatable Read_ isolation level only sees data committed before the transaction began; it never sees either uncommitted data or changes committed during transaction execution by concurrent transactions. \(However, the query does see the effects of previous updates executed within its own transaction, even though they are not yet committed.\) This is a stronger guarantee than is required by the SQL standard for this isolation level, and prevents all of the phenomena described in [Table 13.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/transaction-iso.html#MVCC-ISOLEVEL-TABLE) except for serialization anomalies. As mentioned above, this is specifically allowed by the standard, which only describes the _minimum_ protections each isolation level must provide.

This level is different from Read Committed in that a query in a repeatable read transaction sees a snapshot as of the start of the first non-transaction-control statement in the _transaction_, not as of the start of the current statement within the transaction. Thus, successive `SELECT` commands within a _single_ transaction see the same data, i.e., they do not see changes made by other transactions that committed after their own transaction started.

Applications using this level must be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization failures.

`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, and `SELECT FOR SHARE` commands behave the same as `SELECT` in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows that were committed as of the transaction start time. However, such a target row might have already been updated \(or deleted or locked\) by another concurrent transaction by the time it is found. In this case, the repeatable read transaction will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or roll back \(if it is still in progress\). If the first updater rolls back, then its effects are negated and the repeatable read transaction can proceed with updating the originally found row. But if the first updater commits \(and actually updated or deleted the row, not just locked it\) then the repeatable read transaction will be rolled back with the message

```text
ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update
```

because a repeatable read transaction cannot modify or lock rows changed by other transactions after the repeatable read transaction began.

When an application receives this error message, it should abort the current transaction and retry the whole transaction from the beginning. The second time through, the transaction will see the previously-committed change as part of its initial view of the database, so there is no logical conflict in using the new version of the row as the starting point for the new transaction's update.

Note that only updating transactions might need to be retried; read-only transactions will never have serialization conflicts.

The Repeatable Read mode provides a rigorous guarantee that each transaction sees a completely stable view of the database. However, this view will not necessarily always be consistent with some serial \(one at a time\) execution of concurrent transactions of the same level. For example, even a read only transaction at this level may see a control record updated to show that a batch has been completed but _not_ see one of the detail records which is logically part of the batch because it read an earlier revision of the control record. Attempts to enforce business rules by transactions running at this isolation level are not likely to work correctly without careful use of explicit locks to block conflicting transactions.

#### Note

Prior to PostgreSQL version 9.1, a request for the Serializable transaction isolation level provided exactly the same behavior described here. To retain the legacy Serializable behavior, Repeatable Read should now be requested.

#### 13.2.3. Serializable Isolation Level

The _Serializable_ isolation level provides the strictest transaction isolation. This level emulates serial transaction execution for all committed transactions; as if transactions had been executed one after another, serially, rather than concurrently. However, like the Repeatable Read level, applications using this level must be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization failures. In fact, this isolation level works exactly the same as Repeatable Read except that it monitors for conditions which could make execution of a concurrent set of serializable transactions behave in a manner inconsistent with all possible serial \(one at a time\) executions of those transactions. This monitoring does not introduce any blocking beyond that present in repeatable read, but there is some overhead to the monitoring, and detection of the conditions which could cause a _serialization anomaly_ will trigger a _serialization failure_.

As an example, consider a table `mytab`, initially containing:

```text
 class | value
-------+-------
     1 |    10
     1 |    20
     2 |   100
     2 |   200
```

Suppose that serializable transaction A computes:

```text
SELECT SUM(value) FROM mytab WHERE class = 1;
```

and then inserts the result \(30\) as the `value` in a new row with `class` `= 2`. Concurrently, serializable transaction B computes:

```text
SELECT SUM(value) FROM mytab WHERE class = 2;
```

and obtains the result 300, which it inserts in a new row with `class` `= 1`. Then both transactions try to commit. If either transaction were running at the Repeatable Read isolation level, both would be allowed to commit; but since there is no serial order of execution consistent with the result, using Serializable transactions will allow one transaction to commit and will roll the other back with this message:

```text
ERROR:  could not serialize access due to read/write dependencies among transactions
```

This is because if A had executed before B, B would have computed the sum 330, not 300, and similarly the other order would have resulted in a different sum computed by A.

When relying on Serializable transactions to prevent anomalies, it is important that any data read from a permanent user table not be considered valid until the transaction which read it has successfully committed. This is true even for read-only transactions, except that data read within a _deferrable_ read-only transaction is known to be valid as soon as it is read, because such a transaction waits until it can acquire a snapshot guaranteed to be free from such problems before starting to read any data. In all other cases applications must not depend on results read during a transaction that later aborted; instead, they should retry the transaction until it succeeds.

To guarantee true serializability PostgreSQL uses _predicate locking_, which means that it keeps locks which allow it to determine when a write would have had an impact on the result of a previous read from a concurrent transaction, had it run first. In PostgreSQL these locks do not cause any blocking and therefore can _not_ play any part in causing a deadlock. They are used to identify and flag dependencies among concurrent Serializable transactions which in certain combinations can lead to serialization anomalies. In contrast, a Read Committed or Repeatable Read transaction which wants to ensure data consistency may need to take out a lock on an entire table, which could block other users attempting to use that table, or it may use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT FOR SHARE` which not only can block other transactions but cause disk access.

Predicate locks in PostgreSQL, like in most other database systems, are based on data actually accessed by a transaction. These will show up in the [`pg_locks`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/view-pg-locks.html) system view with a `mode` of `SIReadLock`. The particular locks acquired during execution of a query will depend on the plan used by the query, and multiple finer-grained locks \(e.g., tuple locks\) may be combined into fewer coarser-grained locks \(e.g., page locks\) during the course of the transaction to prevent exhaustion of the memory used to track the locks. A `READ ONLY`transaction may be able to release its SIRead locks before completion, if it detects that no conflicts can still occur which could lead to a serialization anomaly. In fact, `READ ONLY`transactions will often be able to establish that fact at startup and avoid taking any predicate locks. If you explicitly request a `SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY DEFERRABLE` transaction, it will block until it can establish this fact. \(This is the _only_ case where Serializable transactions block but Repeatable Read transactions don't.\) On the other hand, SIRead locks often need to be kept past transaction commit, until overlapping read write transactions complete.

Consistent use of Serializable transactions can simplify development. The guarantee that any set of successfully committed concurrent Serializable transactions will have the same effect as if they were run one at a time means that if you can demonstrate that a single transaction, as written, will do the right thing when run by itself, you can have confidence that it will do the right thing in any mix of Serializable transactions, even without any information about what those other transactions might do, or it will not successfully commit. It is important that an environment which uses this technique have a generalized way of handling serialization failures \(which always return with a SQLSTATE value of '40001'\), because it will be very hard to predict exactly which transactions might contribute to the read/write dependencies and need to be rolled back to prevent serialization anomalies. The monitoring of read/write dependencies has a cost, as does the restart of transactions which are terminated with a serialization failure, but balanced against the cost and blocking involved in use of explicit locks and `SELECT FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT FOR SHARE`, Serializable transactions are the best performance choice for some environments.

While PostgreSQL's Serializable transaction isolation level only allows concurrent transactions to commit if it can prove there is a serial order of execution that would produce the same effect, it doesn't always prevent errors from being raised that would not occur in true serial execution. In particular, it is possible to see unique constraint violations caused by conflicts with overlapping Serializable transactions even after explicitly checking that the key isn't present before attempting to insert it. This can be avoided by making sure that _all_ Serializable transactions that insert potentially conflicting keys explicitly check if they can do so first. For example, imagine an application that asks the user for a new key and then checks that it doesn't exist already by trying to select it first, or generates a new key by selecting the maximum existing key and adding one. If some Serializable transactions insert new keys directly without following this protocol, unique constraints violations might be reported even in cases where they could not occur in a serial execution of the concurrent transactions.

For optimal performance when relying on Serializable transactions for concurrency control, these issues should be considered:

* Declare transactions as `READ ONLY` when possible.
* Control the number of active connections, using a connection pool if needed. This is always an important performance consideration, but it can be particularly important in a busy system using Serializable transactions.
* Don't put more into a single transaction than needed for integrity purposes.
* Don't leave connections dangling “idle in transaction” longer than necessary. The configuration parameter [idle\_in\_transaction\_session\_timeout](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-IDLE-IN-TRANSACTION-SESSION-TIMEOUT) may be used to automatically disconnect lingering sessions.
* Eliminate explicit locks, `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, and `SELECT FOR SHARE` where no longer needed due to the protections automatically provided by Serializable transactions.
* When the system is forced to combine multiple page-level predicate locks into a single relation-level predicate lock because the predicate lock table is short of memory, an increase in the rate of serialization failures may occur. You can avoid this by increasing [max\_pred\_locks\_per\_transaction](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-locks.html#GUC-MAX-PRED-LOCKS-PER-TRANSACTION), [max\_pred\_locks\_per\_relation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-locks.html#GUC-MAX-PRED-LOCKS-PER-RELATION), and/or [max\_pred\_locks\_per\_page](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-locks.html#GUC-MAX-PRED-LOCKS-PER-PAGE).
* A sequential scan will always necessitate a relation-level predicate lock. This can result in an increased rate of serialization failures. It may be helpful to encourage the use of index scans by reducing [random\_page\_cost](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-RANDOM-PAGE-COST) and/or increasing [cpu\_tuple\_cost](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CPU-TUPLE-COST). Be sure to weigh any decrease in transaction rollbacks and restarts against any overall change in query execution time.
