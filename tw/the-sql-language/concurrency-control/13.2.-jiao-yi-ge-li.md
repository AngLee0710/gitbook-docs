# 13.2. 交易隔離

SQL 標準中定義了四個等級的交易隔離，其中最嚴格的隔離是「Serializable（序列化）」。序列化在標準的描述中，被定義為任意序列化交易的並行操作，都會保證產出與依照某種任意順序一個一個執行它們的效果相同。The other three levels are defined in terms of phenomena, resulting from interaction between concurrent transactions, which must not occur at each level. The standard notes that due to the definition of Serializable, none of these phenomena are possible at that level. \(This is hardly surprising -- if the effect of the transactions must be consistent with having been run one at a time, how could you see any phenomena caused by interactions?\)

其他三個等級則是經由現象來定義的，即在不同的並行交易間的互動，這些現象在各個等集中必不能發生。標準中也注意到，基於 Serializable 的定義，這些現象都不可能發生在 Serializable 等級。（這並不難理解 -- 如果交易的影響必須與一個一個執行的結果一致，你怎麼會看到這些因為互動而產生的現象呢？）

在不同等級中被禁止的現象是：

`dirty read（髒讀）`
交易讀取的資料是由尚未提交的並行交易寫入的。

`nonrepeatable read（無法重複的讀取）`
交易重新讀取它之前讀過的資料，但是卻發現資料被其他交易修改（在最初讀取之後提交）了。

`phantom read（幻讀）`
交易重新執行查詢，得到滿足搜尋條件的資料集，但卻發現得到的資料集因為其他最近剛提交的交易而變更了。

`serialization anomaly（序列化異常）`
在成功提交一群交易後，結果與以所有可能的順序依序執行交易的結果都不一致。

SQL 標準以及 PostgreSQL 實作的交易隔離等級，可參閱 Table 13.1。

**Table 13.1. 交易隔離等級**

| 隔離等級 | Dirty Read | Nonrepeatable Read | Phantom Read | Serialization Anomaly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Read uncommitted | 允許，但 PG 中不會 | 可能 | 可能 | 可能 |
| Read committed | 不可能 | 可能 | 可能 | 可能 |
| Repeatable read | 不可能 | 不可能 | 允許，但 PG 中不會 | 可能 |
| Serializable | 不可能 | 不可能 | 不可能 | 不可能 |

在 PostgreSQL 當中，你可以要求上述四種交易隔離等級的任何一種，但在 PostgreSQL 內部實際上實作的只有三種隔離等級。舉例來說，PostgreSQL 的 Read Uncommitted 模式跟 Read Committed 的行為很相像，這是因為這是能夠把標準的隔離等級對應到 PostgreSQL 的 MVCC 架構的明智方法。

表格中也顯示了 PostgreSQL 的 Repeatable Read 的實作並不允許 phantom read。關於這點，在 SQL 標準中，更嚴格的行為是被容許的：標準中定義的四個隔離等級，只定義了哪些現象必須不會發生，而沒有定義哪些現象 _必須_ 發生。可用的隔離等級的行為，在接下來的小節中會詳細描述。

若要設定交易的隔離等級，可使用指令 [SET TRANSACTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-set-transaction.html)。

#### 重要

有些 PostgreSQL 的資料型態和函式具有特殊的交易行為的規則。具體來說，對序列（以及以 `serial` 宣告的計算器欄位）造成的變更將會立刻能夠被所有其他交易所看見，並且即使造成變更的交易取消了也不會被還原。請參考 [9.16 小節](../functions-and-operators/9.16.-xu-lie-han-shi) 及 [8.1.4 小節](../data-types/numeric-types#8-1-4-xu-lie-xing-serial-types)。

#### 13.2.1. Read Committed Isolation Level

_Read Committed（提交讀）_ 是 PostgreSQL 預設的隔離等級。當交易使用這個隔離等級時，一個 `SELECT` 的查詢（沒有 `FOR UPDATE/SHARE` 的宣告）只會看見在查詢開始前已經被提交的資料；它不會看見尚未提交的資料或者是在查詢執行過程中被並行的交易提交的變更。實際上，`SELECT` 查詢是看見了在查詢開始執行的那一瞬間的資料庫快照。然而，`SELECT` 會看見在它自己的交易中比它先執行的更新，即使那些更新尚未被提交。同時需要注意的是，對於兩個成功的 `SELECT` 指令，如果其他交易在第一個 `SELECT` 開始後、第二個 `SELECT` 開始前提交變更，則即使這兩個 `SELECT` 在同一個交易中也可能會看見不同的資料，

`UPDATE`、`DELETE`、`SELECT FOR UPDATE`、和 `SELECT FOR SHARE` 在搜尋目標資料列的行為與 `SELECT` 一樣：它們只會找出在指令開始時已經被提交的目標資料列。然而，這些資料列在被找到的時候，有可能已經被其他並行交易更新（或者刪除、鎖定），在這個情況下，這個更新者會等待第一個更新的交易提交或者還原（如果那個交易還正在進行中）。如果第一個更新者還原了，那麼它的影響就無效了，第二個更新者會以原本找到的資料列做更新。而當第一個更新者提交了的狀況，若它把資料列刪除，則第二個更新者會忽略這個資料列，否則其他狀況下第二個更新者會嘗試在更新後的資料列上套用它要做的操作。此時指令中的搜尋條件（`WHERE` 宣告）會被重新評估，看看更新後的資料列是否依然符合搜尋條件，如果符合的話，第二個更新者就會對更新後的資料列套用它的操作。在 `SELECT FOR UPDATE` 和 `SELECT FOR SHARE` 的案例中，這代表會對更新後的資料列上鎖並回傳給客戶端。

包含 `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` 宣告的 `INSERT` 的行為也很相似。在 Read Committed 模式中，每個插入的資料列會被插入或者更新，除非有其他不相關的錯誤，否則會保證兩種結果的其中一種發生。如果衝突來自於其影響尚未能被 `INSERT` 所看見的其他交易，即使指令可能 _沒有_ 該資料列在慣例上可見的版本，`UPDATE` 宣告也將會影響那個資料列。

包含 `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` 宣告的 `INSERT` 在其他交易的影響尚未在 `INSERT` 的快照中可見的狀況，有可能不會執行插入。再次強調，這是只有在 Read Committed 模式的案例。

因為上述的規則，對更新的指令來說有可能會看見不一致的快照：它能夠看見其他並行的更新指令對它嘗試要更新的資料列的影響，但它不會看見這些其他指令對資料庫裡的其他資料列的影響。這個行為使得 Read Committed 模式並不適合牽涉到複雜的搜尋條件的指令；然而，它對於比較簡單的案例卻是剛剛好。例如，考慮以下更新銀行餘額的交易：

```text
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 7534;
COMMIT;
```

如果兩個這樣的交易並行嘗試更新帳戶 12345 的餘額，我們顯然會希望第二個交易以帳戶資料列的更新後版本開始。因為每個指令都只會影響可預先決定的資料列，使得讓它看到更新後的資料列版本並不會造成任何有問題的不一致。

其他更複雜的使用狀況，在 Read Committed 模式中可以產生出並非期望的結果。例如考慮一個 `DELETE` 指令，要操作正好從它的限制條件中加入和移除的資料，像是假設 `website` 是一張有兩個資料列的表格，其中 `website.hits` 分別為 `9` 和 `10`：

```text
BEGIN;
UPDATE website SET hits = hits + 1;
-- run from another session:  DELETE FROM website WHERE hits = 10;
COMMIT;
```

即使在 `UPDATE` 之前與之後，都存在 `website.hits = 10` 的資料列，但 `DELETE` 指令不會產生任何影響。這是因為更新前值為 `9` 的資料列已經被忽略了，並且當 `UPDATE` 執行完成且 `DELETE` 取得鎖，新的資料列的值已經不是 `10` 而是 `11`，不再滿足限制條件了。

因為 Read Committed 模式在每個指令開始時會取得包含在那個瞬間已經提交的所有交易的快照，其後在同個交易中的指令無論如何都會看到並行交易提交的影響。上述的爭論點在於 _單一_ 指令是否看見資料庫完全一致的視野。

The partial transaction isolation provided by Read Committed mode is adequate for many applications, and this mode is fast and simple to use; however, it is not sufficient for all cases. Applications that do complex queries and updates might require a more rigorously consistent view of the database than Read Committed mode provides.

#### 13.2.2. Repeatable Read Isolation Level

The _Repeatable Read_ isolation level only sees data committed before the transaction began; it never sees either uncommitted data or changes committed during transaction execution by concurrent transactions. \(However, the query does see the effects of previous updates executed within its own transaction, even though they are not yet committed.\) This is a stronger guarantee than is required by the SQL standard for this isolation level, and prevents all of the phenomena described in [Table 13.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/transaction-iso.html#MVCC-ISOLEVEL-TABLE) except for serialization anomalies. As mentioned above, this is specifically allowed by the standard, which only describes the _minimum_ protections each isolation level must provide.

This level is different from Read Committed in that a query in a repeatable read transaction sees a snapshot as of the start of the first non-transaction-control statement in the _transaction_, not as of the start of the current statement within the transaction. Thus, successive `SELECT` commands within a _single_ transaction see the same data, i.e., they do not see changes made by other transactions that committed after their own transaction started.

Applications using this level must be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization failures.

`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, and `SELECT FOR SHARE` commands behave the same as `SELECT` in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows that were committed as of the transaction start time. However, such a target row might have already been updated \(or deleted or locked\) by another concurrent transaction by the time it is found. In this case, the repeatable read transaction will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or roll back \(if it is still in progress\). If the first updater rolls back, then its effects are negated and the repeatable read transaction can proceed with updating the originally found row. But if the first updater commits \(and actually updated or deleted the row, not just locked it\) then the repeatable read transaction will be rolled back with the message

```text
ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update
```

because a repeatable read transaction cannot modify or lock rows changed by other transactions after the repeatable read transaction began.

When an application receives this error message, it should abort the current transaction and retry the whole transaction from the beginning. The second time through, the transaction will see the previously-committed change as part of its initial view of the database, so there is no logical conflict in using the new version of the row as the starting point for the new transaction's update.

Note that only updating transactions might need to be retried; read-only transactions will never have serialization conflicts.

The Repeatable Read mode provides a rigorous guarantee that each transaction sees a completely stable view of the database. However, this view will not necessarily always be consistent with some serial \(one at a time\) execution of concurrent transactions of the same level. For example, even a read only transaction at this level may see a control record updated to show that a batch has been completed but _not_ see one of the detail records which is logically part of the batch because it read an earlier revision of the control record. Attempts to enforce business rules by transactions running at this isolation level are not likely to work correctly without careful use of explicit locks to block conflicting transactions.

#### Note

Prior to PostgreSQL version 9.1, a request for the Serializable transaction isolation level provided exactly the same behavior described here. To retain the legacy Serializable behavior, Repeatable Read should now be requested.

#### 13.2.3. Serializable Isolation Level

The _Serializable_ isolation level provides the strictest transaction isolation. This level emulates serial transaction execution for all committed transactions; as if transactions had been executed one after another, serially, rather than concurrently. However, like the Repeatable Read level, applications using this level must be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization failures. In fact, this isolation level works exactly the same as Repeatable Read except that it monitors for conditions which could make execution of a concurrent set of serializable transactions behave in a manner inconsistent with all possible serial \(one at a time\) executions of those transactions. This monitoring does not introduce any blocking beyond that present in repeatable read, but there is some overhead to the monitoring, and detection of the conditions which could cause a _serialization anomaly_ will trigger a _serialization failure_.

As an example, consider a table `mytab`, initially containing:

```text
 class | value
-------+-------
     1 |    10
     1 |    20
     2 |   100
     2 |   200
```

Suppose that serializable transaction A computes:

```text
SELECT SUM(value) FROM mytab WHERE class = 1;
```

and then inserts the result \(30\) as the `value` in a new row with `class` `= 2`. Concurrently, serializable transaction B computes:

```text
SELECT SUM(value) FROM mytab WHERE class = 2;
```

and obtains the result 300, which it inserts in a new row with `class` `= 1`. Then both transactions try to commit. If either transaction were running at the Repeatable Read isolation level, both would be allowed to commit; but since there is no serial order of execution consistent with the result, using Serializable transactions will allow one transaction to commit and will roll the other back with this message:

```text
ERROR:  could not serialize access due to read/write dependencies among transactions
```

This is because if A had executed before B, B would have computed the sum 330, not 300, and similarly the other order would have resulted in a different sum computed by A.

When relying on Serializable transactions to prevent anomalies, it is important that any data read from a permanent user table not be considered valid until the transaction which read it has successfully committed. This is true even for read-only transactions, except that data read within a _deferrable_ read-only transaction is known to be valid as soon as it is read, because such a transaction waits until it can acquire a snapshot guaranteed to be free from such problems before starting to read any data. In all other cases applications must not depend on results read during a transaction that later aborted; instead, they should retry the transaction until it succeeds.

To guarantee true serializability PostgreSQL uses _predicate locking_, which means that it keeps locks which allow it to determine when a write would have had an impact on the result of a previous read from a concurrent transaction, had it run first. In PostgreSQL these locks do not cause any blocking and therefore can _not_ play any part in causing a deadlock. They are used to identify and flag dependencies among concurrent Serializable transactions which in certain combinations can lead to serialization anomalies. In contrast, a Read Committed or Repeatable Read transaction which wants to ensure data consistency may need to take out a lock on an entire table, which could block other users attempting to use that table, or it may use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT FOR SHARE` which not only can block other transactions but cause disk access.

Predicate locks in PostgreSQL, like in most other database systems, are based on data actually accessed by a transaction. These will show up in the [`pg_locks`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/view-pg-locks.html) system view with a `mode` of `SIReadLock`. The particular locks acquired during execution of a query will depend on the plan used by the query, and multiple finer-grained locks \(e.g., tuple locks\) may be combined into fewer coarser-grained locks \(e.g., page locks\) during the course of the transaction to prevent exhaustion of the memory used to track the locks. A `READ ONLY`transaction may be able to release its SIRead locks before completion, if it detects that no conflicts can still occur which could lead to a serialization anomaly. In fact, `READ ONLY`transactions will often be able to establish that fact at startup and avoid taking any predicate locks. If you explicitly request a `SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY DEFERRABLE` transaction, it will block until it can establish this fact. \(This is the _only_ case where Serializable transactions block but Repeatable Read transactions don't.\) On the other hand, SIRead locks often need to be kept past transaction commit, until overlapping read write transactions complete.

Consistent use of Serializable transactions can simplify development. The guarantee that any set of successfully committed concurrent Serializable transactions will have the same effect as if they were run one at a time means that if you can demonstrate that a single transaction, as written, will do the right thing when run by itself, you can have confidence that it will do the right thing in any mix of Serializable transactions, even without any information about what those other transactions might do, or it will not successfully commit. It is important that an environment which uses this technique have a generalized way of handling serialization failures \(which always return with a SQLSTATE value of '40001'\), because it will be very hard to predict exactly which transactions might contribute to the read/write dependencies and need to be rolled back to prevent serialization anomalies. The monitoring of read/write dependencies has a cost, as does the restart of transactions which are terminated with a serialization failure, but balanced against the cost and blocking involved in use of explicit locks and `SELECT FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT FOR SHARE`, Serializable transactions are the best performance choice for some environments.

While PostgreSQL's Serializable transaction isolation level only allows concurrent transactions to commit if it can prove there is a serial order of execution that would produce the same effect, it doesn't always prevent errors from being raised that would not occur in true serial execution. In particular, it is possible to see unique constraint violations caused by conflicts with overlapping Serializable transactions even after explicitly checking that the key isn't present before attempting to insert it. This can be avoided by making sure that _all_ Serializable transactions that insert potentially conflicting keys explicitly check if they can do so first. For example, imagine an application that asks the user for a new key and then checks that it doesn't exist already by trying to select it first, or generates a new key by selecting the maximum existing key and adding one. If some Serializable transactions insert new keys directly without following this protocol, unique constraints violations might be reported even in cases where they could not occur in a serial execution of the concurrent transactions.

For optimal performance when relying on Serializable transactions for concurrency control, these issues should be considered:

* Declare transactions as `READ ONLY` when possible.
* Control the number of active connections, using a connection pool if needed. This is always an important performance consideration, but it can be particularly important in a busy system using Serializable transactions.
* Don't put more into a single transaction than needed for integrity purposes.
* Don't leave connections dangling “idle in transaction” longer than necessary. The configuration parameter [idle\_in\_transaction\_session\_timeout](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-IDLE-IN-TRANSACTION-SESSION-TIMEOUT) may be used to automatically disconnect lingering sessions.
* Eliminate explicit locks, `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, and `SELECT FOR SHARE` where no longer needed due to the protections automatically provided by Serializable transactions.
* When the system is forced to combine multiple page-level predicate locks into a single relation-level predicate lock because the predicate lock table is short of memory, an increase in the rate of serialization failures may occur. You can avoid this by increasing [max\_pred\_locks\_per\_transaction](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-locks.html#GUC-MAX-PRED-LOCKS-PER-TRANSACTION), [max\_pred\_locks\_per\_relation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-locks.html#GUC-MAX-PRED-LOCKS-PER-RELATION), and/or [max\_pred\_locks\_per\_page](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-locks.html#GUC-MAX-PRED-LOCKS-PER-PAGE).
* A sequential scan will always necessitate a relation-level predicate lock. This can result in an increased rate of serialization failures. It may be helpful to encourage the use of index scans by reducing [random\_page\_cost](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-RANDOM-PAGE-COST) and/or increasing [cpu\_tuple\_cost](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CPU-TUPLE-COST). Be sure to weigh any decrease in transaction rollbacks and restarts against any overall change in query execution time.
