# 38.8. Procedural Language Functions

PostgreSQL allows user-defined functions to be written in other languages besides SQL and C. These other languages are generically called _procedural languages_ \(PLs\). Procedural languages aren't built into the PostgreSQL server; they are offered by loadable modules. See [Chapter 42](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/xplang.html) and following chapters for more information.
