# 9. 函式及運算子[^1]

PostgreSQLprovides a large number of functions and operators for the built-in data types. Users can also define their own functions and operators, as described in[Part V](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/server-programming.html). Thepsqlcommands`\df`and`\do`can be used to list all available functions and operators, respectively.

If you are concerned about portability then note that most of the functions and operators described in this chapter, with the exception of the most trivial arithmetic and comparison operators and some explicitly marked functions, are not specified by theSQLstandard. Some of this extended functionality is present in otherSQLdatabase management systems, and in many cases this functionality is compatible and consistent between the various implementations. This chapter is also not exhaustive; additional functions appear in relevant sections of the manual.
