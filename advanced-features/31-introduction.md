# 3.1. 簡介[^1]

In the previous chapter we have covered the basics of usingSQLto store and access your data inPostgreSQL. We will now discuss some more advanced features ofSQLthat simplify management and prevent loss or corruption of your data. Finally, we will look at somePostgreSQLextensions.

This chapter will on occasion refer to examples found in[Chapter 2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/tutorial-sql.html)to change or improve them, so it will be useful to have read that chapter. Some examples from this chapter can also be found in`advanced.sql`in the tutorial directory. This file also contains some sample data to load, which is not repeated here. \(Refer to[Section 2.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/tutorial-sql-intro.html)for how to use the file.\)
