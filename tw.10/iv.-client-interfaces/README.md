# IV. 用戶端介面

This part describes the client programming interfaces distributed with PostgreSQL. Each of these chapters can be read independently. Note that there are many other programming interfaces for client programs that are distributed separately and contain their own documentation \([Appendix H](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/external-projects.html) lists some of the more popular ones\). Readers of this part should be familiar with using SQL commands to manipulate and query the database \(see [Part II](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql.html)\) and of course with the programming language that the interface uses.
