# III. 系統管理

This part covers topics that are of interest to aPostgreSQLdatabase administrator. This includes installation of the software, set up and configuration of the server, management of users and databases, and maintenance tasks. Anyone who runs aPostgreSQLserver, even for personal use, but especially in production, should be familiar with the topics covered in this part.

The information in this part is arranged approximately in the order in which a new user should read it. But the chapters are self-contained and can be read individually as desired. The information in this part is presented in a narrative fashion in topical units. Readers looking for a complete description of a particular command should see[Part VI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/reference.html).

The first few chapters are written so they can be understood without prerequisite knowledge, so new users who need to set up their own server can begin their exploration with this part. The rest of this part is about tuning and management; that material assumes that the reader is familiar with the general use of thePostgreSQLdatabase system. Readers are encouraged to look at[Part I](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/tutorial.html)and[Part II](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql.html)for additional information.
