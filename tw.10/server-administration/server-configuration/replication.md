# 19.6. Replication

這些設定控制內建的串流複寫功能行為（請參閱[第 26.2.5 節](../26.-high-availability-load-balancing-and-replication/26.2.-log-shipping-standby-servers.md#26-2-5-streaming-replication)）。伺服器指的是主伺服務器或備用伺服器。主伺服器可以發送資料，而備用伺服器始終是複寫資料的接收者。當使用串聯複寫（請參閱[第 26.2.7 節](../26.-high-availability-load-balancing-and-replication/26.2.-log-shipping-standby-servers.md#26-2-7-cascading-replication)）時，備用伺服器也可以是發送者和接收者。參數主要用於發送和備用伺服器，但某些參數僅在主伺服器上有意義。如果需要，設定是跨群集的，不會産生問題。

## 19.6.1. 發送伺服器

可以在將資料複寫發送到一個或多個備用伺服器的任何伺服器上設定這些參數。主伺服器始終是發送伺服器，因此必須在主伺服器上設定這些參數。備用資料庫成為主資料庫後，這些參數的作用也不會改變。

`max_wal_senders` \(`integer`\)

指定來自備用伺服器或串流複寫備份用戶端的最大同時連線數（即同時運行的 WAL 發送程序的最大數量）。預設值為 10，0 表示停用複寫。WAL 發送方程序也計入連線總數，因此參數不能設定高於 [max\_connections](connections-and-authentication.md#19-3-1-ding)。突然串流用戶端中斷連線可能會導致遺留連線插槽，直到達到超時。因此此參數應設定為略高於預期用戶端的最大數量，以便中斷連線的用戶端可以立即重新連線。此參數只能在伺服器啟動時設定。wal\_level 必須設定為副本或更高版本才能允許來自備用伺服器的連線。

`max_replication_slots` \(`integer`\)

指定伺服器可以支援的最大複寫槽數（請參閱[第 26.2.6 節](../26.-high-availability-load-balancing-and-replication/26.2.-log-shipping-standby-servers.md#26-2-6-replication-slots)）。預設值為 10。此參數只能在伺服器啟動時設定。必須將 wal\_level 設定為副本或更高版本才能使用複寫槽。將其設定為低於目前現有複寫插槽數的值將阻止伺服器啟動。

`wal_keep_segments` \(`integer`\)

指定保留在 pg\_wal 目錄中的過時日誌段落檔案的最小數量，以防備用伺服器需要取得它們以進行串流複寫。每個段落段通常為 16 MB。如果連線到發送伺服器的備用伺服器落後於 wal\_keep\_segments 個段落以上，則發送伺服器可能會刪除備用資料庫仍需要的 WAL 段落，在這種情況下，複寫連線將會終止。因此，下游連線最終也會失敗。（但是，如果正在使用 WAL Archive，則備用伺服器可以透過從 Archive 中取得段落來進行回復。）

這僅設定 pg\_wal 中保留的最小段落數量；系統可能需要為 WAL 存檔保留更多段落或從檢查點回復。如果 wal\_keep\_segments 為零（預設值），則系統不會為備用目的保留任何額外的段落，因此備用伺服器可用的舊 WAL 段落數是上一個檢查點的位置和WAL 歸檔狀態的函數。此參數只能在 postgresql.conf 檔案或伺服器命令列中設定。

`wal_sender_timeout` \(`integer`\)

終止靜止狀態超過指定毫秒數的複寫連線。這對於發送伺服器檢測備用伺服器當機或網路斷線很有用。值為零會停用超時機制。此參數只能在 postgresql.conf 檔案或伺服器命令列中設定。預設值為 60 秒。

`track_commit_timestamp` \(`boolean`\)

記錄事務的提交時間。此參數只能在 postgresql.conf 檔案或伺服器命令列中設定。預設值為 off。

## 19.6.2. Master Server

These parameters can be set on the master/primary server that is to send replication data to one or more standby servers. Note that in addition to these parameters, [wal\_level](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-LEVEL) must be set appropriately on the master server, and optionally WAL archiving can be enabled as well \(see [Section 19.5.3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-ARCHIVING)\). The values of these parameters on standby servers are irrelevant, although you may wish to set them there in preparation for the possibility of a standby becoming the master.`synchronous_standby_names` \(`string`\)

Specifies a list of standby servers that can support _synchronous replication_, as described in [Section 26.2.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION). There will be one or more active synchronous standbys; transactions waiting for commit will be allowed to proceed after these standby servers confirm receipt of their data. The synchronous standbys will be those whose names appear in this list, and that are both currently connected and streaming data in real-time \(as shown by a state of `streaming` in the [`pg_stat_replication`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-VIEWS-TABLE) view\). Specifying more than one synchronous standby can allow for very high availability and protection against data loss.

The name of a standby server for this purpose is the `application_name` setting of the standby, as set in the standby's connection information. In case of a physical replication standby, this should be set in the `primary_conninfo` setting in `recovery.conf`; the default is`walreceiver`. For logical replication, this can be set in the connection information of the subscription, and it defaults to the subscription name. For other replication stream consumers, consult their documentation.

This parameter specifies a list of standby servers using either of the following syntaxes:

```text
[FIRST] num_sync ( standby_name [, ...] )
ANY num_sync ( standby_name [, ...] )
standby_name [, ...]
```

where _`num_sync`_ is the number of synchronous standbys that transactions need to wait for replies from, and _`standby_name`_ is the name of a standby server. `FIRST` and `ANY` specify the method to choose synchronous standbys from the listed servers.

The keyword `FIRST`, coupled with _`num_sync`_, specifies a priority-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to _`num_sync`_ synchronous standbys chosen based on their priorities. For example, a setting of`FIRST 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)` will cause each commit to wait for replies from three higher-priority standbys chosen from standby servers `s1`, `s2`, `s3` and `s4`. The standbys whose names appear earlier in the list are given higher priority and will be considered as synchronous. Other standby servers appearing later in this list represent potential synchronous standbys. If any of the current synchronous standbys disconnects for whatever reason, it will be replaced immediately with the next-highest-priority standby. The keyword `FIRST` is optional.

The keyword `ANY`, coupled with _`num_sync`_, specifies a quorum-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to _at least_ _`num_sync`_ listed standbys. For example, a setting of `ANY 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)` will cause each commit to proceed as soon as at least any three standbys of `s1`, `s2`, `s3` and `s4` reply.

`FIRST` and `ANY` are case-insensitive. If these keywords are used as the name of a standby server, its _`standby_name`_ must be double-quoted.

The third syntax was used before PostgreSQL version 9.6 and is still supported. It's the same as the first syntax with `FIRST` and _`num_sync`_ equal to 1. For example, `FIRST 1 (s1, s2)` and `s1, s2` have the same meaning: either `s1` or `s2` is chosen as a synchronous standby.

The special entry `*` matches any standby name.

There is no mechanism to enforce uniqueness of standby names. In case of duplicates one of the matching standbys will be considered as higher priority, though exactly which one is indeterminate.

#### Note

Each _`standby_name`_ should have the form of a valid SQL identifier, unless it is `*`. You can use double-quoting if necessary. But note that _`standby_name`_s are compared to standby application names case-insensitively, whether double-quoted or not.

If no synchronous standby names are specified here, then synchronous replication is not enabled and transaction commits will not wait for replication. This is the default configuration. Even when synchronous replication is enabled, individual transactions can be configured not to wait for replication by setting the [synchronous\_commit](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT) parameter to `local` or `off`.

This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

`vacuum_defer_cleanup_age` \(`integer`\)

Specifies the number of transactions by which `VACUUM` and HOT updates will defer cleanup of dead row versions. The default is zero transactions, meaning that dead row versions can be removed as soon as possible, that is, as soon as they are no longer visible to any open transaction. You may wish to set this to a non-zero value on a primary server that is supporting hot standby servers, as described in [Section 26.5](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/hot-standby.html). This allows more time for queries on the standby to complete without incurring conflicts due to early cleanup of rows. However, since the value is measured in terms of number of write transactions occurring on the primary server, it is difficult to predict just how much additional grace time will be made available to standby queries. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

You should also consider setting `hot_standby_feedback` on standby server\(s\) as an alternative to using this parameter.

This does not prevent cleanup of dead rows which have reached the age specified by `old_snapshot_threshold`.

## 19.6.3. Standby Servers

These settings control the behavior of a standby server that is to receive replication data. Their values on the master server are irrelevant.

`hot_standby` \(`boolean`\)

Specifies whether or not you can connect and run queries during recovery, as described in [Section 26.5](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/hot-standby.html). The default value is `on`. This parameter can only be set at server start. It only has effect during archive recovery or in standby mode.

`max_standby_archive_delay` \(`integer`\)

When Hot Standby is active, this parameter determines how long the standby server should wait before canceling standby queries that conflict with about-to-be-applied WAL entries, as described in [Section 26.5.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/hot-standby.html#HOT-STANDBY-CONFLICT). `max_standby_archive_delay` applies when WAL data is being read from WAL archive \(and is therefore not current\). The default is 30 seconds. Units are milliseconds if not specified. A value of -1 allows the standby to wait forever for conflicting queries to complete. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

Note that `max_standby_archive_delay` is not the same as the maximum length of time a query can run before cancellation; rather it is the maximum total time allowed to apply any one WAL segment's data. Thus, if one query has resulted in significant delay earlier in the WAL segment, subsequent conflicting queries will have much less grace time.

`max_standby_streaming_delay` \(`integer`\)

When Hot Standby is active, this parameter determines how long the standby server should wait before canceling standby queries that conflict with about-to-be-applied WAL entries, as described in [Section 26.5.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/hot-standby.html#HOT-STANDBY-CONFLICT). `max_standby_streaming_delay` applies when WAL data is being received via streaming replication. The default is 30 seconds. Units are milliseconds if not specified. A value of -1 allows the standby to wait forever for conflicting queries to complete. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

Note that `max_standby_streaming_delay` is not the same as the maximum length of time a query can run before cancellation; rather it is the maximum total time allowed to apply WAL data once it has been received from the primary server. Thus, if one query has resulted in significant delay, subsequent conflicting queries will have much less grace time until the standby server has caught up again.

`wal_receiver_status_interval` \(`integer`\)

Specifies the minimum frequency for the WAL receiver process on the standby to send information about replication progress to the primary or upstream standby, where it can be seen using the [`pg_stat_replication`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-VIEWS-TABLE) view. The standby will report the last write-ahead log location it has written, the last position it has flushed to disk, and the last position it has applied. This parameter's value is the maximum interval, in seconds, between reports. Updates are sent each time the write or flush positions change, or at least as often as specified by this parameter. Thus, the apply position may lag slightly behind the true position. Setting this parameter to zero disables status updates completely. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. The default value is 10 seconds.

`hot_standby_feedback` \(`boolean`\)

Specifies whether or not a hot standby will send feedback to the primary or upstream standby about queries currently executing on the standby. This parameter can be used to eliminate query cancels caused by cleanup records, but can cause database bloat on the primary for some workloads. Feedback messages will not be sent more frequently than once per `wal_receiver_status_interval`. The default value is `off`. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

If cascaded replication is in use the feedback is passed upstream until it eventually reaches the primary. Standbys make no other use of feedback they receive other than to pass upstream.

This setting does not override the behavior of `old_snapshot_threshold` on the primary; a snapshot on the standby which exceeds the primary's age threshold can become invalid, resulting in cancellation of transactions on the standby. This is because `old_snapshot_threshold` is intended to provide an absolute limit on the time which dead rows can contribute to bloat, which would otherwise be violated because of the configuration of a standby.

`wal_receiver_timeout` \(`integer`\)

Terminate replication connections that are inactive longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This is useful for the receiving standby server to detect a primary node crash or network outage. A value of zero disables the timeout mechanism. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. The default value is 60 seconds.

`wal_retrieve_retry_interval` \(`integer`\)

Specify how long the standby server should wait when WAL data is not available from any sources \(streaming replication, local `pg_wal` or WAL archive\) before retrying to retrieve WAL data. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. The default value is 5 seconds. Units are milliseconds if not specified.

This parameter is useful in configurations where a node in recovery needs to control the amount of time to wait for new WAL data to be available. For example, in archive recovery, it is possible to make the recovery more responsive in the detection of a new WAL log file by reducing the value of this parameter. On a system with low WAL activity, increasing it reduces the amount of requests necessary to access WAL archives, something useful for example in cloud environments where the amount of times an infrastructure is accessed is taken into account.

## 19.6.4. Subscribers

These settings control the behavior of a logical replication subscriber. Their values on the publisher are irrelevant.

Note that `wal_receiver_timeout`, `wal_receiver_status_interval` and `wal_retrieve_retry_interval` configuration parameters affect the logical replication workers as well.

`max_logical_replication_workers` \(`int`\)

Specifies maximum number of logical replication workers. This includes both apply workers and table synchronization workers.

Logical replication workers are taken from the pool defined by `max_worker_processes`.

The default value is 4.

`max_sync_workers_per_subscription` \(`integer`\)

Maximum number of synchronization workers per subscription. This parameter controls the amount of parallelism of the initial data copy during the subscription initialization or when new tables are added.

Currently, there can be only one synchronization worker per table.

The synchronization workers are taken from the pool defined by `max_logical_replication_workers`.

The default value is 2.
