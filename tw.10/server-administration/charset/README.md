# 23. 語系

This chapter describes the available localization features from the point of view of the administrator. PostgreSQL supports two localization facilities:

* Using the locale features of the operating system to provide locale-specific collation order, number formatting, translated messages, and other aspects. This is covered in [Section 23.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/locale.html) and [Section 23.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/collation.html).
* Providing a number of different character sets to support storing text in all kinds of languages, and providing character set translation between client and server. This is covered in [Section 23.3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/multibyte.html).
