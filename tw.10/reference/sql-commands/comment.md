### Description

`COMMENT` stores a comment about a database object.

Only one comment string is stored for each object, so to modify a comment, issue a new `COMMENT` command for the same object. To remove a comment, write `NULL` in place of the text string. Comments are automatically dropped when their object is dropped.

For most kinds of object, only the object's owner can set the comment. Roles don't have owners, so the rule for `COMMENT ON ROLE` is that you must be superuser to comment on a superuser role, or have the `CREATEROLE` privilege to comment on non-superuser roles. Likewise, access methods don't have owners either; you must be superuser to comment on an access method. Of course, a superuser can comment on anything.

Comments can be viewed using psql's `\d` family of commands. Other user interfaces to retrieve comments can be built atop the same built-in functions that psql uses, namely `obj_description`, `col_description`, and `shobj_description` \(see [Table 9.68](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/functions-info.html#FUNCTIONS-INFO-COMMENT-TABLE)\).

### Parameters

_`object_name`_  
_`relation_name`_._`column_name`_  
_`aggregate_name`_  
_`constraint_name`_  
_`function_name`_  
_`operator_name`_  
_`policy_name`_  
_`rule_name`_  
_`trigger_name`_

The name of the object to be commented. Names of tables, aggregates, collations, conversions, domains, foreign tables, functions, indexes, operators, operator classes, operator families, sequences, statistics, text search objects, types, and views can be schema-qualified. When commenting on a column, _`relation_name`_ must refer to a table, view, composite type, or foreign table.

_`table_name`_  
_`domain_name`_

When creating a comment on a constraint, a trigger, a rule or a policy these parameters specify the name of the table or domain on which that object is defined.

_`source_type`_

The name of the source data type of the cast.

_`target_type`_

The name of the target data type of the cast.

_`argmode`_

The mode of a function or aggregate argument: `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`. Note that `COMMENT` does not actually pay any attention to `OUT` arguments, since only the input arguments are needed to determine the function's identity. So it is sufficient to list the `IN`, `INOUT`, and `VARIADIC` arguments.

_`argname`_

The name of a function or aggregate argument. Note that `COMMENT` does not actually pay any attention to argument names, since only the argument data types are needed to determine the function's identity.

_`argtype`_

The data type of a function or aggregate argument.

_`large_object_oid`_

The OID of the large object.

_`left_type`_  
_`right_type`_

The data type\(s\) of the operator's arguments \(optionally schema-qualified\). Write `NONE` for the missing argument of a prefix or postfix operator.

`PROCEDURAL`

This is a noise word.

_`type_name`_

The name of the data type of the transform.

_`lang_name`_

The name of the language of the transform.

_`text`_

The new comment, written as a string literal; or `NULL` to drop the comment.

### Notes

There is presently no security mechanism for viewing comments: any user connected to a database can see all the comments for objects in that database. For shared objects such as databases, roles, and tablespaces, comments are stored globally so any user connected to any database in the cluster can see all the comments for shared objects. Therefore, don't put security-critical information in comments.

### Examples

Attach a comment to the table `mytable`:

```text
COMMENT ON TABLE mytable IS 'This is my table.';
```

Remove it again:

```text
COMMENT ON TABLE mytable IS NULL;
```

Some more examples:

```text
